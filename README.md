# python_AlgorithmicComplexity

Look up DIVIDE AND CONQUER and recursive strategies
--> three stages to split problem into
1)TRIVIAL: If solution is trivial then return solution

2. DIVIDE: Else Divide input into Input 1, Input 2
   3)COMBINE: return combined(sol1, sol2)

Look up Quicksort and Mergesort (use divide and combine stages differently in sorting)

For shuffle: USE SWAP IN FUCNTION: Take first Item and swap with random integer, comb thru whole ARRAY
