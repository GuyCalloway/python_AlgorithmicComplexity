# Algorithmic Complexity

## Make sure your python Environment includes:

- numpy
- unittest
- timer
- matplotlib

## To test speed of functions:

- Add method names to list in Graph_Plotter file under
  `if __name__ == '__main__':`
- Set Upper range (max sized array to test)
- set increments (increase of number in array from one array to the next till upper range reached)
- Set limit (randomises each array point between 1 --> limit)
- Run:
  `$ python3 graph_plotter.py`
- Graph will pop up plotting the time taken for each method to complete action on range of array sizes specified above
